		<h4>Event Management</h4>
		</div>
		<p>Admission time is one of the most crucial times in a student’s life.
		It’s also a nerve-breaking period of time, with parents hectically running from one college to another seeking admission for their wards. The admission process rules and regulations are often tedious, which makes the entire procedure stressful for both the aspirants and their parents.
		This is where we come to the fore. Each year, NSS DTU volunteers in providing guidance to the admission seekers, thus ensuring a smooth and hassle free admission procedure. We address queries regarding admission process, provide counseling on subjects or course material, acquaint them with the college environment, etc.
