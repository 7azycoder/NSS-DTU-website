		<h4>Events during Engifest DTU</h4>
		</div>
		<p>Engifest is the annual cultural festival of DTU. It is a four-day-long cultural extravaganza held in the month of February. It bridges the gap between technical education and creativity.
We take delight in adding our own touch to this cultural and diverse college fest.

		</p>
		<p>
			During the Engifest’14, NSS DTU tried adding a little essence of benevolence in the  event  by  approaching  the  Akhil BharatJan   Kalyan   NGO   from   13th    February   to   16th February,2014. The team set up  a  stall named 'Aanchal' that sold handicraft products made by Vaibhav Lakshmi Self Help Group. The stall rose more than Rs. 5000. NSS DTU espouses the motto "Not Me But You". We, the enthusiastic volunteers of NSS DTU team, contributed in the ENGIFEST celebrations of 2015 in our own unique way to highlight this motto. We had majorly three events:
			</p>
		<ul class="accordion">
			<li class="active">
			<div class="title">
				<b>NGO Help Desk</b>
			</div>
			<div class="content" style="overflow: hidden; display: block; ">
				<p>
				Where there's a will, there is a way! A noble objective to extend a helping hand to any person who wishes to support an NGO but has no clue how to approach one. At the help desk, we provided requisite information to people about different NGO's, their nature of work, past projects and most importantly how to be a part of their social program.
				<br><br>



				A signing campaign was also held at the help desk in which students of DTU and other colleges wrote a social message starting with 'I want...' and signed against it.
				Anyone with a will to work with an NGO, found a way at their very own help desk.

				<b>Handicrafts Workshop and Sale </b>
			</div>
			<div class="content" style="overflow: hidden; display: none; ">
				<p>
               Handicrafts are beautiful creations made by God's own creations. 
				NSS DTU, in collaboration with "Kalakriti Zone" organized a handicrafts workshop at Emanuel Seva Ashram, Bhaupura, Sahibabad (U.P.).
				<br><br>
				The workshop intended to bring to fore the innate artistic expressions and creative juices present in children belonging to poor socio-economic strata. It was a delightful experience to watch children play innocently with colors, using their vivid imagination and creative acumen. They keenly noticed the intricacies of handmade craftwork and with the help of the experts turned ordinary looking items into beautiful 'masterpieces'. The kids had great time painting earthen wall hangings, modeling ordinary looking clay to classy earrings, making handmade photo frames using colorful sheets and cutting the mundane A3 sheets to beautiful bookmarks.
				<br><br>
 				Engifest 2015 hosted the sale of these exquisite handicrafts. The kiosk attracted a lot of customers who were amazed to learn that children as young as 4 years of age had put in their creative talent to form the awe-inspiring craftworks; which included colorful wall hangings, earthen vases & pots, baskets, photo frames, bookmarks and earrings. The kiosk was a hit amongst the fest visitors and had a whopping collection of over ₹1,800. This amount was sent as charity to the Emmanuel Seva Group as a goodwill donation by NSS-DTU.

				<b>Supports Village</b>
			</div>
			<div class="content" style="overflow: hidden; display: none; ">
				<p>
				"All work and no play makes Jack dull". Sports is an integral part of life and even the academically driven students of our college would agree! 
				NSS DTU organized sports events and collected nominal fee from participants whose proceeds went towards charity to the Emmanuel Seva Group. Hence, fun derived from sports activities became multifold when a noble cause was associated with it.<br><br>

				Our traditional sports were an instant hit among the students. 
				<br>We organized the following sports: 
				<br>Sack race 
				<br>Lemon race 
				<br>7 stones (pitthu)
 <br><br>These simple yet challenging games saw huge participation from students of DTU and other colleges.




                </p>

		NSS DTU successfully made its mark in Engifest 2015 and we hope to continue this practice of blending fun and frolic with work towards a social cause in the upcoming years.
