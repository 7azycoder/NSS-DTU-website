				NSS volunteers along with three students from university of Michigan are working at SSF, The Skilled Samaritan. it is a social enterprise that aims to make Indian villages self sustainable, both technically and economically by bringing individuals and community into a larger dialogue by matching volunteers to projects and opportunities within the social contexts of environment, clean energy, education, and economics. 

				<br><br>The first visit was to a village, 40km from Delhi, named Sirohi where two groups were made, first, the solar electrification team and second, handicrafts team. Solar electrification team focused on placing as well as removing solar panels from the roofs of houses, mosques etc. and the handicrafts section conducted a survey to acquire knowledge about the various skills of  women in Sirohi( like making charpoys, rugs, stools etc.). The handicrafts team was asked to get business from dealers in Delhi, which seemed interested in buying products made by women in Sirohi. 

				<br><br>Sirohi adjoins a small village named khiori, where the volunteers performed the same task. After this visit the solar electrification team went to another village in shrutkal, U.P. the team set up solar panels at 5 sites
